All of these scripts were based off of the scripts posted here https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=701200.0 you
can follow the guide there if it is easier. All of the scripts here have been edited and are working correctly.

In pool_configs and set a very high payment like so.
    "paymentProcessing": {
        "enabled": true,
       "paymentInterval": 75,
        "minimumPayment": 99999999999,
        "daemon": {

so that the shift is paid out by the scripts that are going to be run from this folder. Either on a cron or by hand.
Example of crontab -e could be:

0 */2 * * *                     ~/unomp/multipool/exchange.sh >~/unomp/multipool/alerts/cronexchange.log 2>&1
*/30 * * * *                    ~/unomp/multipool/price.sh >~/unomp/multipool/alerts/cronprice.log 2>&1
*/5 * * * *                     ~/unomp/multipool/average.sh >~/unomp/multipool/alerts/cronaverage.log 2>&1
*/5 * * * *                     ~/unomp/multipool/profit.sh >~/unomp/multipool/alerts/cronprofit.log 2>&1


Next go to your config.json in the base folder and change the validateWorkerUsername to false:

    "defaultPoolConfigs": {
        "blockRefreshInterval": 1000,
        "jobRebroadcastTimeout": 55,
        "connectionTimeout": 600,
        "emitInvalidBlockHashes": false,
        "validateWorkerUsername": false,
        /* */

For any and all coins you're adding you will have to go to the multipool/bin folder and run
one of the *redis.sh <coinname> scripts to add them to redis. This goes for coins that are
only on the pool to be mined! Example:
    
    sh sharedis.sh neoscoin
    
This will add each of the coins on the pool into the database for the exchange rates, profit script,
and check worker balances. These should match the .json file coin names.

./profit.sh will calculate the workers estimated earning based off of the balances they have mined in each coin
and set an entry in the database for each.
./payment.sh will clear the workers balance and pay all of the workers from the coindaemon of your choice.

REDIS COMMANDER will start on port 8081 and let you get a full view of your redis database. 
Make sure to close off that port when installing
To install and run
npm install -g redis-commander
